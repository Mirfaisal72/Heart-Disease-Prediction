# Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression
This repository contains a machine learning model to predict heart disease using logistic regression. Logistic regression is a commonly used algorithm for binary classification tasks, and in this case, we will use it to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease or not based on certain input features.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about several individuals, including their medical and lifestyle attributes, and a binary label indicating whether they have heart disease or not. The dataset has been preprocessed and split into training and testing sets to build and evaluate the model.

# Model Evaluation
The trained logistic regression model will be evaluated on the test dataset, and the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics will be displayed. These metrics provide insights into the model's performance in predicting heart disease
